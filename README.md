# Paper "AStar (...) - under review".

Follows the file names that correspond to Fig. 5 through Fig. 9 of the paper. For each figure, we create two files: a JSON Schema (whose file name ends with "schema.js") and a sample code to insert documents in the database (the same code sample showed in the paper). The figures Fig. 5 through Fig. 9 will be inserted on this page after the publication of the article.
